Hello everyone, my name is Billy. I'm a third year CS major and I love coding, drawing and designing. I play a lot of sports, including soccer, badminton, and pingpong (havent done any for a while). I am also an anime fan, and speak Japanese for that sake XD.

Ideas: I just got in LOL, no clues yet. But I am pretty familiar with full stack development, and did a lot with javascript and python. We will see how it goes.
