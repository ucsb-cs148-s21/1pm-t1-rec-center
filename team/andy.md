Hello everyone, my name is Andy. I'm a third year CS major and some of my interests include video games, cars, and being outdoors. 

Ideas: For the application, I was thinking that we could monitor the amount of people in the rec center by taking either looking at their geolocation or by having some counter when people walk in and out of the rec if we don't want to use location services.
