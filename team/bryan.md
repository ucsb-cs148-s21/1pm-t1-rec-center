Hi! My name is Bryan. I'm a third year CS student, and my interests outside of coding include Smash, anime, and badminton. I was previously a ULA for CS16, and I'm looking forward to working together!

My idea for this web app is to make a application that will display the capacity of the rec cen at all times, though I am unsure about how to actually obtain the numbers inside. I would like to do more research on how the library capacity web app works, and perhaps base it off of that.
