Hi everyone, my name is Silvia Yu. I'm a third year Computer Science major. My interests outside of coding are playing escape room and watching anime.

Ideas: I missed the first lectures and discussion section, and I am not very sure what have discussed. I think being able to accurately monitor how many people are in the rec center is the most important part.
