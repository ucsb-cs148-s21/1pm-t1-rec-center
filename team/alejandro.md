Hello y'all. My name is Alejandro, and I am a second year majoring in Computer Science. 
Aside from learning to be a better devopler, my interests are in cryptocurrency, videogames, weight lifting, and movies.

My ideas for the web application is to track the amount of people in the gym is by looking how other appications have done it 
and learning from them. Also, we can find the best time for the user to go to the rec cen based off 
their google calender (for schedule purposes) and the capacity of the gym.
