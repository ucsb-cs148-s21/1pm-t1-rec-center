# User Journey

Goal: gain information about traffic patterns at rec center, so that users can go at times with less people

Series of events:
- As a user, I can check the current traffic at the rec center, so that I can determine if it's a good time to go
- As a user, I can check the expected traffic a few hours ahead, so that I can plan out my schedule
- As a user, I can add my schedule to the app, so that I can receive a list of best times to go to the rec center
- As an administrator, I can see the different traffic levels, so that I can assign rec center workers accordingly
- As an administrator, I can assign certain days as closed, so that users will be informed that the rec center is not open
